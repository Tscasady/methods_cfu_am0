# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  - I feel very confident using Ruby built in methods and reading their documentation.


- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  - I am very confident that I can effectively write simple methods of my own.


- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  - I am very curious about how to build methods with interfaces. I don't know a lot about them but I know that a method like each can iterate over a variety of objects of different data types and forms by using them. Seems very powerful.
